## Summary
Add comprehensive architecture documentation with PlantUML diagrams and complete project scaffold for Cosmic Flight Simulator

## Changes
- ✅ Created complete documentation structure in `docs/` folder
- ✅ Generated 6 PlantUML diagrams for architecture visualization
- ✅ Added embedded PNG diagram images
- ✅ Created modular project scaffold structure
- ✅ Added requirements.txt with Python dependencies
- ✅ Updated README with documentation links

## Type of Change
- [x] Documentation update
- [x] New feature

## Description

### What Changed?

**Documentation Files Added:**
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture with embedded diagram images
- `docs/DIAGRAMS.md` - Complete PlantUML source code for all 6 diagrams
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Development roadmap and TODO lists
- `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` - Detailed feature specifications
- `docs/SETUP.md` - Installation and setup guide
- `docs/README.md` - Documentation index

**Visual Diagrams Generated:**
- System Architecture Diagram (overall system)
- Class Diagram (core classes and relationships)
- Data Flow Sequence (user interaction flow)
- Component Interaction (runtime interactions)
- Deployment Diagram (technology stack)
- Mission State Flow (state transitions)

**Project Structure Created:**
```
ai-playground/
├── src/
│   ├── simulator/    # Physics and spacecraft
│   ├── cockpit/      # User interface
│   └── visualization/# 3D rendering
├── tests/            # Test structure
├── assets/           # Game assets
└── missions/         # Mission files
```

### Why These Changes?

- Provides visual documentation of system architecture
- Establishes clear foundation for implementation
- Enables better understanding for new contributors
- Includes all requirements and setup instructions
- Creates structured scaffold ready for development

### How to Test?

1. View documentation files in the `docs/` folder
2. Check that diagram images are embedded and visible
3. Verify PlantUML diagrams can be rendered online
4. Review project structure completeness
5. Test that README links work correctly

## Screenshots/Demo

- Architecture diagrams are embedded in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- PlantUML diagrams can be viewed in `docs/DIAGRAMS.md`
- All diagrams are also available as PNG images in `docs/images/`

## Checklist
- [x] Code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Self-review completed
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] No breaking changes

## Additional Notes

This is a documentation-only PR that establishes the foundation for the Cosmic Flight Simulator project. All files are scaffolded with TODO comments for future implementation.

**Key Features:**
- Modular architecture (simulator, cockpit, visualization)
- Realistic space physics simulation
- Interactive cockpit controls
- 3D visualization system
- Mission-based gameplay

**Next Steps:**
- Implement physics engine
- Add cockpit controls
- Create 3D rendering system
- Develop mission system
