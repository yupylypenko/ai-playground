# User Flows

This document describes the user flows and navigation paths in the Cosmic Flight Simulator based on the current implementation and planned features.

## Application Entry Flow

### Startup Sequence
```
User launches application
  ↓
main.py initialized
  ↓
Pygame initialized (display, mixer, fonts)
  ↓
MainMenuScreen displayed
  ↓
User interacts with menu
```

### Initialization
- Display resolution: 1280x720 (default), responsive to screen size
- Fullscreen toggle: F11
- Starfield background rendered
- Fonts loaded with responsive scaling
- Audio system initialized (optional)

## Main Menu Flow

### Primary Navigation
```
MainMenuScreen
  ├── Free Flight → [Future: Flight Simulator]
  ├── Tutorial → [Future: Tutorial Missions]
  ├── Missions → [Future: Mission Selection]
  ├── Settings → SettingsScreen
  └── Quit → Exit Application
```

### User Interaction Methods

#### Mouse Navigation
1. User moves mouse over menu option
   - Triggers hover state
   - Color changes to highlight color
   - Optional hover sound plays
   
2. User clicks on menu option
   - Triggers selected state
   - Click sound plays (if enabled)
   - Fade-out transition begins (~250ms)
   - Returns selected MenuOption enum value

#### Keyboard Navigation
1. User presses Arrow Keys
   - Up/Down: Navigate through menu options
   - Wraps around at boundaries
   
2. User presses Enter/Space
   - Confirms selection
   - Triggers click logic
   
3. User presses F11
   - Toggles fullscreen mode
   
4. User presses 'A'
   - Toggles accessibility mode (high-contrast)

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: All clicks respond within 0.1 seconds
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate color change on hover
- **Transitions**: Smooth 250ms fade-in/out
- **Frame Rate**: Maintains 30-60 FPS

## Settings Screen Flow

### Settings Navigation
```
SettingsScreen
  ├── Display → [Future: Resolution, Fullscreen, Quality]
  ├── Audio → [Future: Volume, Effects, Music]
  ├── Controls → [Future: Key Bindings, Sensitivity]
  ├── Accessibility → [Future: Font Scale, High Contrast]
  └── Back to Main Menu → MainMenuScreen
```

### User Interactions

#### Mouse Interaction
- Hover over category highlights it
- Click selects category
- Click "Back" returns to Main Menu

#### Keyboard Interaction
- Arrow Keys: Navigate categories
- Enter/Space: Select category
- ESC: Return to Main Menu (shortcut)

### Settings State Management
Currently settings are passed as constructor parameters:
- `fullscreen: bool`
- `font_scale: float` (0.75 - 2.0)
- `high_contrast: bool`
- `enable_sounds: bool`

Future: Persistent settings stored in config file
